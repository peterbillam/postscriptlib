(That had been an extraordinarily brilliant time. For example, just the \
couple of years around 1910 gave us Stravinsky's Petrushka, and the Rite \
of Spring, Bartók's Bluebeard's Castle, Debussy's La Mer and Ravel's \
Daphnis and Chloe, Schoenberg's Five Orchestral Pieces, Busoni's Doktor \
Faust, Delius' A Mass of Life, Scriabin's Prometheus, all the late Mahler \
symphonies including The Song Of The Earth, and Elektra and Salome from \
Richard Strauss. And those are just the big pieces. All that in just a \
couple of years! It's a phenomenal outpouring.) def
